# Paino-record-and-replay-using-aurdino
In this project prototype of a piano utilizing an Arduino is implemented. This piano consists of 8
push buttons each representing 8 notes of the music and a buzzer to produce the sounds. It utilizes the tone() function of Arduino to
make different sorts of piano notes on the buzzer. There is a special feature of recording the tones played using push buttons and
replaying them on will.Thisproject has indirect real time applications , it can be used to comprehend certain features of Arduino (like its
sound creating abilities utilizing the tone () function).
